# Write a method that takes a floating point number that represents an angle between 0 and 360 degrees and returns a String that represents that angle in degrees, minutes and seconds. You should use a degree symbol (°) to represent degrees, a single quote (') to represent minutes, and a double quote (") to represent seconds. A degree has 60 minutes, while a minute has 60 seconds.

# Note: your results may differ slightly depending on how you round values, but should be within a second or two of the results shown.

# You should use two digit numbers with leading zeros when formatting the minutes and seconds, e.g., 321°03'07".

# You may use this constant to represent the degree symbol:

# DEGREE = "\xC2\xB0"

DEGREE = "\xC2\xB0"
