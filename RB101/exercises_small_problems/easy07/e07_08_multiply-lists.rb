Write a method that takes two Array arguments
in which each Array contains a list of numbers, 
and returns a new Array that contains the product of each 
pair of numbers from the arguments that have the same index. 
You may assume that the arguments contain the same number of elements.

def multiply_list (array_1, array_2)
  product_array = []
  i = 0
  loop do
    
  end
end

multiply_list([3, 5, 7], [9, 10, 11]) == [27, 50, 77]
