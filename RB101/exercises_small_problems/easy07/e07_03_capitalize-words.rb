# Capitalize Words

# Write a method that takes a single String argument and returns a new
# string that contains the original value of the argument with the
# first character of every word capitalized and all other letters lowercase.

# You may assume that words are any sequence of non-blank characters.

def word_cap(string)
  string.split.map(&:capitalize).join(' ')

puts word_cap('four score and seven') == 'Four Score And Seven'
puts word_cap('the javaScript language') == 'The Javascript Language'
puts word_cap('this is a "quoted" word') == 'This Is A "quoted" Word'
