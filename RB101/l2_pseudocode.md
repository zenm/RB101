For example, write out pseudo-code (both casual and formal) that does the following:

## a method that returns the sum of two integers
    
Take two integers
test if the two are integers
return the addition of the two integers.
  
    
## a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

* You want a method that is given an array_of_strings
* Take an empty string
* Iterate through the array 
* and add it to the empty string
* return the no longer empty string


##a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

* START method 
* READ Array
* RETURN IF no array or if array doesn't have * numbers
* SET every_other_element
* ITERATE through array
* IF index is even
  take the element at the index and add it to the every_other_array
* RETURN every_other_element
* END
