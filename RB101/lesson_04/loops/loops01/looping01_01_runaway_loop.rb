# The code below is an example of an infinite loop.
# The name describes exactly what it does: loop infinitely.
# This loop isn't useful in a real program, though.
# Modify the code so the loop stops after the first iteration.

# loop do
#   puts 'Just keep printing...'
# end

# input
# output:
# nil
# outputs 'Just keep printing...'
# requirements:
# break the loop after one iteration

loop do
  puts 'Just keep printing...'
  break
end
